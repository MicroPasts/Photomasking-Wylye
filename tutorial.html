                This application is very simple (but it does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a photograph of an archaeological artefact. Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to click or tap around the edge of the artefact in order to define a polygon outline. Click once every time you wish to add a point along the edge of the polygon and your final point will snap back onto the one you started with. You can draw one polygon around the entire object or instead draw a series of overlapping polygons if you prefer. In general, we would like you to draw your polygon(s) very slightly inside the actual edge of the artefact. This is because we don't want background pixels near this edge to create a fuzzy border, and we don't need to worry so much about losing a bit of the artefact edge, as the missing few pixels are very likely to appear in one of the other photographs (at least 40 overlapping photographs are likely to exist for each object to support the construction of the 3D model). An example of a successful outline is shown below:
